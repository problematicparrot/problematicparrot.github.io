The FOSSpository is a user-made repository for Free and Open Source Softwares that
are readily available for Windows, Mac, and Linux users.

FOSS softwares are expansive and community made, letting anyone use them for no fee,
and sometimes accepting payments through only donations given by the users themselves.
