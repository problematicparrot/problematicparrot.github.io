## Linux Distros

### Parrot Security/Home

Parrot Security OS is a Debian based distro focused on giving the user
both a desktop they can use daily, along with various cracking and
pen testing tools.

Parrot Home generally has similar features to Parrot Security, but
it lacks pen testing tools and also comes with a KDE Plasma 5 version.

### Ubuntu

The one and only Ubuntu, a secure boot compatible distro with a
much less complicated desktop environment. Based off of Debian,
this much more new-user friendly distro allows an easier
transition from more mainstream operating systems like Apple's
MacOS and Windows 10.
