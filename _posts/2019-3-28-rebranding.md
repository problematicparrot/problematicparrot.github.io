title: The Problematic Parrot Posting Platform has rebranded to the FOSSpository!
---

Problematic Parrot didn't see this blog going anywhere, so he decided to create
a repository for free and open-source softwares for all to use!

Ranging from simple office programs to complex image manipulation packages,
the FOSSpository will have an ever-growing list of programs to use,
with no charge!

(As of 3/28/19 10:23 PST, the list is currently empty)
