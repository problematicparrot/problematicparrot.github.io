I don't know the exact reason why, but for some reason, it seems like springtime over on the west coast
isn't actually coming in at all.

The weather's just being bipolar with summer and winter and my allergies are kicking up even though there
isn't a speck of pollen in sight or stuck on various cars.

Then again, the tree that's in my front yard is currently reverse blooming and during the days and nights
it's getting colder than Norway, but I don't know.

Seasons are pretty weird.
